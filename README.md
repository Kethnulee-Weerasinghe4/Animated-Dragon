## Overview

Animated Dragon is an interactive SVG-based animation where a mythical dragon smoothly follows the user’s cursor with fluid, organic motion. The project combines procedural animation, dynamic color shifting, and real-time audio synthesis to create an immersive and responsive visual experience.

The dragon is built from reusable SVG segments and animated using custom physics-style logic, giving it a natural “living creature” feel rather than a simple path-follow effect.

- Dynamic color shifting along the body
